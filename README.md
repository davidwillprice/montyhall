# Interactive Monty Hall Problem

>Suppose you are on a game show, and you are given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Although there are already other online versions of the Monty Hall Problem, I wanted to see if I could make a better looking version with more features.

I changed the door's contents from goats and a car to them being empty or having gold behind them to simplify the idea of winning or losing.
